Bad Words:

This is meant to help you highlight words in the text editor which you have placed in a text file which list all the words that you wish to omit from your text file.
The format of the text file should be a single column with either words or phrases in a new line. All words or phrases will be highlighted in the text editor in Emacs so that you may alter them.
