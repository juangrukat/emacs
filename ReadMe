Bad Words:

This is meant to help you highlight words in the text editor which you have placed in a text file which list all the words that you wish to omit from your text file.
The format of the text file should be a single column with either words or phrases in a new line. All words or phrases will be highlighted in the text editor in Emacs so that you may alter them.

You need to insert the code in here:
C-x C-f ~/.emacs.d/init.el

To run:
M-x highlight-badwords-from-file
Then, enter ~/badwords.txt when prompted
